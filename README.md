**[DevTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/devtools.96876/)** is a **Minecraft Java Plugin** that was developed to make a lot of things during developing your own plugin easier (**for Java Developers**).
Whenever you set up your testing server, just install this small plugin and later on it will save you a lot of minutes!

# Features:

## 1. Feature: Location

Have you ever struggled to teleport players to a specific location because you had to copy the location from your F3-Screen? Presenting:  

**/location <player / block / view>**
1.  By typing  **/location player** you will get your location.
2.  By typing  **/location block**, you will get the location of the block you are looking at.
3.  By typing  **/location view**, you will get the location and the player's head rotation.

- **Note**: You can always add a player name to get these values from a specific player!
- You can then either copy the location declaration from the server console or if you click on “Copy” in the chat. The plugin will then paste the needed code into your chat box (copy with control + a & control + c). Since it's the declaration, you can paste it directly into your code!


## 2. Feature: Sound

When developing plugins, you often want to play sound effects. But do you know how all the sounds sound. Typing that sound in, compiling the plugin and then reloading your server seems pretty time-consuming, especially when you want to test multiple sounds and their volume. Presenting:  

**/sound “sound name” <volume / pitch>**  

- By typing  **/sound “sound name”** you can scroll through all available Minecraft sounds.
- **Note**: You can also type in the “**volume**” and “**pitch**” of the sound.


## 3. Feature: Fly

Whenever you need to fly faster than in normal survival or you need to fly in survival (just for testing and not for cheating obviously) this plugin also got u.
**/fly "fly speed"**

- By typing /fly you can activate and deactivate the ability to fly.
- **Note**: You can also type in a flying speed (0.1 - 1.0).
