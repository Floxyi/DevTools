# Features:

## 1. Feature: Location

**/location <player / block / view> \<player name>**  
With this command you can get the location implementation for your Java code.

- **Note**: You can add a player name to get these values from a specific player!
- You can get the location implementation if you click on “**copy**” in the chat. Since it's the declaration, you can paste it directly into your code!


## 2. Feature: Sound

**/sound “sound name” <volume / pitch>**  
With this command you can play every sound in the game before setting it in you code. 


- By typing  **/sound “sound name”** you can scroll through all available Minecraft sounds.
- **Note**: You can also type in the “**volume**” and “**pitch**” of the sound.


## 3. Feature: Fly

**/fly \<fly speed>"**  
With this command you can not only fly in survival but also set a flying speed.

- By typing /fly you can activate and deactivate the ability to fly.
- **Note**: You can also type in a flying speed (0.1 - 1.0).


## 4. Feature: Material

Whenever you need to create a specific item inside your code, just get it in Minecraft, execute this command and copy the code for it from a .txt file.  
**/material**

- When executing this command a .txt file is getting created containing the necessary code.
- **Note**: You can find this code in "%server%/plugins/Devtools/itemCode"
- This feature is experimental, meaning not all properties of all items are supported
